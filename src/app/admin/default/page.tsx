         What is an Exoplanet? An exoplanet is a planet
          that orbits a star outside our Solar System, discovered through
          methods like the transit method. Significance of Exoplanets: They help
          scientists study how planets form and whether they could support life.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          Differences from Solar System Planets: While our planets are mostly
          rocky or gas giants, exoplanets vary more in size, composition, and
          temperature, with some being super-Earths or lava-covered.

          This two-part story could be formatted into a project where Part 1
          explains the discovery and importance of exoplanets, and Part 2 draws
          a comparison with planets in our Solar System. You can also use images
          or animations of the planets and exoplanets to visually support the
          script on your website.
